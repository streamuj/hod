   HLS On Demand


ABOUT

 A set of scripts and a segmenter to generate HLS from various sources when
 requested. Complete with transcoding, AES encryption and simple authentication.

 I use this to stream VDR channels and recordings to my Android phone.


REQUIREMENTS

 Bash & PHP for the scripts.
 FFmpeg for transcoding.
 OpenSSL for AES encryption.


INSTALL

 cd tools
 make
 make install

 Optionally copy the transcoding config file to /etc and edit as needed.

 Put the files in htdocs to appropriate place for webapps and make sure the
 data dir is writable by the http daemon. Edit rc.php, auth.php, sources.php
 and vdr*.php as needed.
